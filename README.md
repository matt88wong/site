# Matthew Wong V1.0

Matthew Wong V1.0 is a website that showcases myself as a developer and as a person

This website was lovingly made from scratch with React, Typescript, CSS, NPM, SASS and HTML5

## How to run locally

### 'yarn start'

This will run the website locally on `localhost:3000`

### 'gulp'

If you change directory to the `src` folder, run gulp and your SCSS changes will be reflected in the locally generated CSS folder

## How to deploy

### 'npm run deploy'
